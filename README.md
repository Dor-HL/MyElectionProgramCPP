# MyElectionProgramCPP
This is the final project in my object oriented programming course in C++ 
This is an election program with several features that can maintain an  election process both in electorial way ( such as in the US) or a single country\county elections.
The program can hold a record of citizens who can vote,record of parties and their leaders , add new citizens,let a citizen cast their votes,keep record of said votes and give out statistics.
The program is built so determine the winner( both in electors- normal elections\in a simple county/country- simple election) as well as give out statistics based on the votes 
The user can also save files of the current election as well as upload old election files and view their information as well as add on to them.
